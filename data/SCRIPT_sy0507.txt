AROUND FOUR HUNDRED TRUCKS CARRYING FUEL AND OIL WERE ATTACKED BY TALIBAN INSURGENTS IN AFGHANISTAN ON FRIDAY — CREATING A MASSIVE BLAZE JUST OUTSIDE OF KABUL.

THE TANKERS WERE LOCATED IN A PARKING DEPOT, REPORTEDLY HOLDING FUEL INTENDED FOR NATO FORCES.

WHILE THERE WERE NO IMMEDIATE REPORTS OF CASUALTIES — THE DESTRUCTION WAS EVIDENT. NEWS FOOTAGE SHOWED MANY TANKERS CHARRED BLACK, WITH SOME FIRES STILL BURNING ON SATURDAY.

AFGHANISTAN’S INTERIOR MINISTRY SAID AROUND TWO HUNDRED TANKERS WERE LEFT COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

THE TALIBAN ALREADY CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ATTACK. THE INSURGENTS REPORTEDLY LAUNCHED ROCKETS AT THE TANKERS — AND FIRED AT DRIVERS WHO TRIED TO TURN ON THEIR VEHICLES.

THIS ATTACK OCCURRED DAYS BEFORE AFGHANISTAN PLANS TO ANNOUNCE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF ITS LATEST PRESIDENTIAL VOTE. THE TALIBAN PUBLICLY VOWED TO DISRUPT THE ELECTION PROCESS.

ON THURSDAY, MILITANTS FIRED ROCKETS INTO KABUL’S INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT AND DESTROYED A HELICOPTER.
