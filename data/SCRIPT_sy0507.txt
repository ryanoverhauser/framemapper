Around four hundred trucks carrying fuel and oil
were attacked by Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan on Friday,
creating a massive blaze just outside of Kabul.
The tankers were located in a parking depot,
reportedly holding fuel intended for NATO forces.
While there were no immediate reports of casualties,
the destruction was evident.
News footage showed many charred tankers,
with some fires still burning on Saturday.
Afghanistan’s interior ministry said
around two hundred tankers were left completely destroyed.
The Taliban already claimed responsibility for the attack.
The insurgents reportedly launched rockets at the tankers
and fired at drivers who tried to turn on their vehicles.
This comes days before Afghanistan plans to announce
preliminary results of its latest presidential vote.
The Taliban publicly vowed to disrupt the election process.
